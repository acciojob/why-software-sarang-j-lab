	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a developer because I am passionate about creating solutions that make a difference. Technology is constantly evolving, and being a developer allows me to learn continuously, solve complex problems, and build applications that people can actually use and benefit from.

I enjoy the process of turning ideas into functional software, whether itâ€™s a website, an app, or an automation tool. It challenges my logical thinking and creativity, and every project gives me an opportunity to grow.

Moreover, being a developer opens doors to collaborating with like-minded people, working on innovative projects, and contributing to the digital world, which motivates me to pursue this career path.
